# Welcome to My Portfolio

## About

Hello, I’m Chayanid (Bam). I have a background in Economics and am currently working as a Senior Reconciliation Executive in the Finance Operations team. Initially, I focused on finance-related tasks, but over time, I developed a growing interest in coding and data analysis. This passion led me to pursue a master's degree in Statistics and Data Science, where I gained deeper knowledge and technical skills. My goal has always been to integrate data-driven insights into finance operations, and my academic journey has been an essential part of this transition.

Now, I am actively applying the skills and knowledge from my master's program to automate various tasks within the Finance Operations team. Using Python, I’ve worked on automating processes such as data downloads, reconciliation reports, and regular data updates. As I continue to deepen my expertise in coding and data, I aim to drive more impactful improvements within my team and the organization. My goal is to further expand my expertise to drive efficiency and create meaningful improvements.
