# Welcome to My Portfolio

## About

Hello, I’m Chayanid (Bam). I have a background in Economics and am currently working as a Senior Reconciliation Executive in the Finance Operations team. Initially, I focused on finance-related tasks, but over time, I developed a growing interest in coding and data analysis. This passion led me to pursue a master's degree in Statistics and Data Science, where I gained deeper knowledge and technical skills. My goal has always been to integrate data-driven insights into finance operations, and my academic journey has been an essential part of this transition.

Now, I am actively applying the skills and knowledge from my master's program to automate various tasks within the Finance Operations team. Using Python, I’ve worked on automating processes such as data downloads, reconciliation reports, and regular data updates. As I continue to deepen my expertise in coding and data, I aim to drive more impactful improvements within my team and the organization. My goal is to further expand my expertise to drive efficiency and create meaningful improvements.

## Portfolio Projects
### 1. Olist E-commerce Data Analysis

Background:
The dataset analyzed is from Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects small businesses to larger marketplaces. The data includes 99,441 orders from March 2016 to August 2018 and has been anonymized to protect customer and seller identities. The dataset offers a comprehensive view of e-commerce operations, covering details such as order status, price, payment methods, freight performance, customer locations, product attributes, and customer reviews. It also includes a geolocation dataset linking Brazilian zip codes to latitude and longitude coordinates.

Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce

Goal: To analyze Olist E-commerce sales trends using SQL for data querying, Python for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for data visualization. The analysis aims to uncover key insights into sales performance, product trends, and delivery peerformance.

Tools: Python(Pandas, Matplotlib), SQL

### 2. Restaurant Orders Analysis

Goal : To analyze customer data and gain insights into menu performance and customer preferences. The analysis focuses on:
1. Exploring the menu_items table to understand the menu offerings.
2. Exploring the order_details table to review collected order data.
3. Combining both tables to evaluate customer reactions to the menu, including new items.

Tools: SQL

Key Insights:
- Italian dishes are the most expensive and have the highest average price, while American dishes are the least expensive.
- Average order size is approximately 2.28 dishes per order
- Bestselling items include Hamburger, Edamame, and Korean Beef Bowl, while least popular are Chicken Tacos, Potstickers, and Lasagna.
- High-value orders (around $190) tend to favor Italian cuisine.

### 3. Automated Reconciliation Report

Goal: To create an automated reconciliation report comparing two datasets (e.g., company transaction data and external source data), showing the daily total amounts for each channel, the differences between the two channels, and the unmatched transaction details.

Tools: Python (Pandas, Openpyxl)

Results: The script outputs a completed reconciliation Excel report that includes a Summary Sheet, which shows the total daily amounts for each channel and highlights differences; Raw Data Sheets, containing detailed transaction records from both datasets; and an Unmatched Details Sheet, listing transactions with amount discrepancies or those present in only one dataset.
