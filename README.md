# Welcome to My Portfolio

## About

Hello, I’m Chayanid (Bam). I have a background in Economics and am currently working as a Senior Reconciliation Executive in the Finance Operations team. Initially, I focused on finance-related tasks, but over time, I developed a growing interest in coding and data analysis. This passion led me to pursue a master's degree in Statistics and Data Science, where I gained deeper knowledge and technical skills. My goal has always been to integrate data-driven insights into finance operations, and my academic journey has been an essential part of this transition.

Now, I am actively applying the skills and knowledge from my master's program to automate various tasks within the Finance Operations team. Using Python, I’ve worked on automating processes such as data downloads, reconciliation reports, and regular data updates. As I continue to deepen my expertise in coding and data, I aim to drive more impactful improvements within my team and the organization. My goal is to further expand my expertise to drive efficiency and create meaningful improvements.

## Portfolio Projects
### 1. Python Project: Automated Reconciliation Report

Goal: To create an automated reconciliation report comparing two datasets (e.g., company transaction data and external source data), showing the daily total amounts for each channel, the differences between the two channels, and the unmatched transaction details.

Tools: Python (Pandas, Openpyxl)

Results: The script outputs a completed reconciliation Excel report that includes a Summary Sheet, which shows the total daily amounts for each channel and highlights differences; Raw Data Sheets, containing detailed transaction records from both datasets; and an Unmatched Details Sheet, listing transactions with amount discrepancies or those present in only one dataset.

### 2. SQL Project: Restaurant Orders Analysis

Goal : To analyze customer data and gain insights into menu performance and customer preferences. The analysis focuses on:
1. Exploring the menu_items table to understand the menu offerings.
2. Exploring the order_details table to review collected order data.
3. Combining both tables to evaluate customer reactions to the menu, including new items.

Tools: SQL

Results:
